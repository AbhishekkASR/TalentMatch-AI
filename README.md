# TalentMatch AI

AI-powered Resume Analysis, ATS Scoring, and Semantic Job Matching Platform.

## Overview

TalentMatch AI is a major project developed to help users analyze resumes against job descriptions using Artificial Intelligence, semantic similarity, ATS scoring, and skill-gap analysis.

The platform allows users to:

* Upload resumes in PDF/Image format
* Paste job descriptions from platforms like Naukri, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.
* Get AI-powered match percentage
* Analyze ATS compatibility
* Detect missing skills
* Receive improvement suggestions
* Get suitable job role recommendations
* Explore external job links

The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentence Transformers, semantic embeddings, and skill extraction techniques to simulate real-world ATS and recruiter evaluation systems.

# Features

## Resume Upload

Users can upload resumes in:

* PDF
* Image formats

The backend extracts readable text automatically.

---

## Semantic Resume Matching

The system uses Sentence Transformers to:

* Convert resume text into embeddings
* Convert job descriptions into embeddings
* Perform cosine similarity matching
* Generate semantic match percentage

---

## ATS Score Analysis

The ATS engine evaluates:

* Resume structure
* Required sections
* Job-description relevance
* Skill alignment
* Resume readability

---

## Skill Gap Analysis

The platform identifies:

* Matched skills
* Missing skills
* Suggested improvements

---

## Job Recommendation System

The system uses the Naukri dataset to:

* Recommend suitable job roles
* Match resume skills with real job postings
* Suggest external job platforms

---

## Modern UI

Frontend inspired by modern ATS checker platforms.

Includes:

* Interactive dashboard
* Score cards
* Skill badges
* Recommendation cards
* Responsive design

# API Endpoint

## Analyze Resume

### POST

```text
/analyze_resume
```

### Form Data

| Parameter       | Type   |
| --------------- | ------ |
| resume_file     | File   |
| job_description | String |

---

# AI Matching Logic

The final resume score is calculated using:

```text
Final Score =
0.60 × Semantic Similarity
+ 0.30 × Skill Match
+ 0.10 × ATS Score
```

---

# ATS Scoring Factors

The ATS score considers:

* Resume structure
* Presence of sections
* Skills relevance
* Keyword matching
* Readability

---

# Dataset Information

The project uses a processed Naukri dataset containing:

* Job titles
* Skills
* Companies
* Locations
* Industry domains
* Experience levels
* Job descriptions

The dataset is used for:

* Role recommendations
* Skill matching
* External job redirection

---

# Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements:

* Authentication system
* Resume history
* Recruiter dashboard
* MongoDB/PostgreSQL integration
* Vector database optimization
* Real-time job APIs
* AI chatbot assistant
* Resume ranking system
* Cloud deployment

---

# Challenges Faced

* Large dataset processing
* Transformer model optimization
* ATS score balancing
* Semantic matching optimization
* Deployment limitations on free hosting
